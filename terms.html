      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions govern access to and use of the Arvox platform (“Arvox,” “the Platform,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By registering for, accessing, or using Arvox in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Platform.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Nature and Purpose of the Platform</h2>

      <p>
        Arvox is a limited-access digital platform designed to connect skilled individuals (“Jobbers”) with projects, organizations, or teams (“Projects”) seeking talent or assistance. The Platform provides structured tools for job postings, bounty listings, applications, payment scheduling, and automated fund disbursement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arvox does not operate as an employer, recruitment agency, broker, or guarantor. All working relationships, contractual arrangements, deliverables, and outcomes exist solely between Jobbers and Projects. Arvox’s role is strictly infrastructural and administrative.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">No Guarantee of Employment or Earnings</h2>

      <p>
        Use of Arvox does not guarantee employment, engagement, selection, income, or financial success. Arvox does not promise that Jobbers will secure work, nor that Projects will successfully fill roles. All decisions regarding hiring, selection, work quality, acceptance, and continuation of engagements are made independently by the involved parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arvox does not evaluate the professional suitability of Jobbers beyond platform-level requirements, nor does it verify the legitimacy or success potential of Projects beyond internal safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Access, Eligibility, and Account Responsibility</h2>

      <p>
        Access to Arvox is restricted and may require invitation codes, approval, verification, or payment. Users must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and throughout their use of the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users are solely responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts and for all activity conducted under their credentials. Arvox reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate access at its discretion where inaccurate information, misuse, misconduct, or behavior that may harm the Platform’s integrity is identified.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">User Conduct and Platform Integrity</h2>

      <p>
        All users are expected to act professionally, lawfully, and in good faith. Misrepresentation of skills, experience, identity, or intent is strictly prohibited. Fraudulent activity, impersonation, spamming, manipulation, or any conduct that undermines trust between users or damages the Platform’s reputation may result in immediate restriction or termination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Projects are responsible for ensuring that job and bounty listings are accurate, lawful, and clearly defined. Jobbers are responsible for delivering work as agreed and maintaining professional standards.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Payments, Enforcement, and Fund Protection</h2>

      <p>
        Arvox operates a structured payment enforcement system designed to protect both Jobbers and Projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        For any accepted job or engagement, payment terms are established in advance and agreed upon by both parties. Payment cycles may be weekly or monthly, depending on the arrangement selected. During the agreed period, Jobbers are expected to complete assigned work, while Projects are expected to fund payments as required by the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Payments are enforced at the Platform level. Funds are scheduled for release to Jobbers at the end of the agreed payment cycle. Projects are not required to release payment prior to the completion of the agreed timeframe, and Jobbers receive payment only after the cycle concludes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structure ensures that:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Jobbers complete work before receiving payment.</li>
        <li>Projects are protected from premature payouts.</li>
        <li>Neither party can unilaterally bypass agreed terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Wallet Connection and Fund Disbursement</h2>

      <p>
        To receive payments, users must connect a valid external wallet supported by the Platform. Funds may temporarily appear within an in-platform balance before being transferred to the connected external wallet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arvox is not responsible for losses resulting from incorrect wallet addresses, unsupported networks, or user-side errors. Once funds are transferred to an external wallet, Arvox no longer has custody or control over those assets.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Disputes, Reports, and Platform Intervention</h2>

      <p>
        If either party fails to meet agreed obligations—whether through non-payment, incomplete work, or misconduct—a report may be filed through the Platform. Arvox may review submitted information, request additional evidence, and take administrative action where necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arvox’s role in disputes is limited to platform-level review and enforcement. Arvox does not act as a court, arbitrator, or legal authority and does not guarantee specific dispute outcomes. Decisions made by Arvox regarding access, restrictions, or enforcement are final and discretionary.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Fees, Pricing, and Platform Charges</h2>

      <p>
        Certain features, access levels, or services on Arvox may require payment. All applicable fees are disclosed prior to purchase. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, fees paid to Arvox are non-refundable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arvox reserves the right to modify pricing, access conditions, or platform offerings at any time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Arvox shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from use of the Platform. Arvox is not responsible for losses related to missed opportunities, disputes between users, or outcomes of engagements conducted through the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users acknowledge that all engagements are entered into at their own risk.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Intellectual Property and Platform Rights</h2>

      <p>
        All platform technology, interfaces, branding, and content are owned by Arvox unless otherwise stated. Unauthorized reproduction, scraping, resale, or exploitation of the Platform or its components is prohibited.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Modifications and Updates</h2>

      <p>
        Arvox may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Platform after changes are published constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Governing Law</h2>

      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with applicable laws, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Acceptance</h2>

      <p>
        By accessing or using Arvox, you confirm that you understand and agree to these Terms and Conditions in full.
